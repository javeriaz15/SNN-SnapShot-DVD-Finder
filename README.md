# SNN-SnapShot-DVD-Finder
This project describes an algorithm based on Siamese Neural Network architecture for a snap-shot app to detect DVD covers and classify them.
'Siamese_NN_DVD_R2.ipynb' contain the code
'Reference data' contain the orignal image data from Stanford mobile Visual Search Database. 
The data have been cleaned for this problem and multiple copies were created for each sample image using 'rotateimg.py'. 
Then each DVD was categorized as train and test, that could be found in 'data'.
